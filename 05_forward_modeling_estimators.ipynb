    "# Tutorial 5: Forward Modeling and Building Convergence Estimators\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the culminating tutorial where we bring everything together! Here you'll learn to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Apply lensing effects** to galaxy catalogues using convergence maps\n",
    "2. **Compare size distributions** between lensed and unlensed galaxies\n",
    "3. **Build estimators** to recover convergence from galaxy size measurements\n",
    "4. **Validate the approach** by testing estimator performance\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates the core method of the KappaBySizes approach: using galaxy size distributions to map convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Core Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "**Forward modeling**: `observed_size = intrinsic_size Ã— (1 + Îº)`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inverse problem**: Given observed sizes, estimate Îº by comparing local size distributions to the global distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial, you will:\n",
    "1. Apply convergence effects to realistic galaxy catalogues\n",
    "2. Analyze the relationship between local and global size distributions\n",
    "3. Implement estimators for convergence recovery\n",
    "4. Validate estimator performance and understand limitations\n",
    "5. Explore advanced topics like nearest-neighbor approaches"
